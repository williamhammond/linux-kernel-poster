This is a set of scripts to create a poster of the Linux kernel
(v2.4.0 at the moment).  This process takes ~9 hours on my 400MHz
Mobile Pentium II laptop.

Thanks to Linuxcare for providing sustenance during coding.

This entire archive is (c) Paul `Rusty' Russell, and placed under the
GPL.

To make the poster:
1) make KERNEL_DIR=<<where-your-2.4.0-kernel-source-is>>

	This will first extract all the functions from the kernel
	source, into a directory called "image/".  This takes several
	hours to run.

	Then it will create a Makefile to generate the final image,
	which it will then run.  This also takes several hours to run.

2) Run posterize, like so:
	./posterize a4 6

   The first argument is the paper size (a4, a3, letter or 11x17), the second
   is the size of the poster: this creates a poster of 6x6 A4 sheets.

3) You will now have all the files called poster.1.1.ps.gz to
   poster.6.6.ps.gz.  You will need to print them, something like so:
	for f in poster*.gz; do zcat $f | lpr -; done

4) From the `poster' man page:
       Our  preferred  method  for  the assembly of a poster from
       multiple sheets is as follows:

       - Arrange the sheets in the proper order on a large  table
         or on the floor.

       - Remove  from  all sheets, except from those in the left-
         most column or bottom row, their left and bottom cutmar-
         gin.

       - In left-to-right and bottom-to-top order, glue the right
         (and top) cutmargin and  stick  the  right  (and  upper)
         neighbouring page on top of that.

       - Turn  the  glued-together  poster  face  bottom, and put
         adhesive tape on the sheet edges (on the backside of the
         poster) for more strength.

       - Remove the remaining cutmargin around the poster.

5) If this is all too hard, posters should soon be on sale at:

Enjoy your poster!
Rusty.
